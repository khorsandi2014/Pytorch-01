        "\n",
        "Embeddings transform a one-hot encoded vector (a vector that is 0 in elements except one, which is 1) into a much smaller dimension vector of real numbers. The one-hot encoded vector is also known as a *sparse vector*, whilst the real valued vector is known as a *dense vector*. \n",
        "\n",
        "The key concept in these word embeddings is that words that appear in similar _contexts_ appear nearby in the vector space, i.e. the Euclidean distance between these two word vectors is small. By context here, we mean the surrounding words. For example in the sentences \"I purchased some items at the shop\" and \"I purchased some items at the store\" the words 'shop' and 'store' appear in the same context and thus should be close together in vector space.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may have also heard about *word2vec*. *word2vec* is an algorithm (actually a bunch of algorithms) that calculates word vectors from a corpus. In this appendix we use *GloVe* vectors, *GloVe* being another algorithm to calculate word vectors. If you want to know how *word2vec* works, check out a two part series [here](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/) and [here](http://mccormickml.com/2017/01/11/word2vec-tutorial-part-2-negative-sampling/), and if you want to find out more about *GloVe*, check the website [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).\n",
